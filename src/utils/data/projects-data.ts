    description: `I am currently working on Online Sahulat, a SaaS-based web application developed using React, Express.js, and MongoDB, targeting grocery stores and mini-marts. The app aims to digitalize manual processes by integrating POS systems with an online presence, enabling store owners to manage inventory, sales, and e-commerce from a single admin panel.

Key features include inventory management, sales reporting, receipt printing, identity verification, and support for cash payments. Vendors can upload products via CSV, which are displayed to nearby users through a mobile app, allowing customers to browse and order essentials like monthly groceries. The mobile app provides a seamless e-commerce experience for users.

Additionally, I implemented Firebase Push Notifications for updates and order alerts and utilized Firebase Storage for managing product and store-related media. The app is designed to simplify operations for vendors while providing a user-friendly shopping experience for customers.`,
