## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize

1. Open the `src/utils/data/` folder.

2. Update the object values in the `personalData.ts` file:

### Example of `personalData.ts`:

```typescript
export const personalData = {
  name: "Your Name",
  profile: "/profile.png", // Replace the image with your transparent public/profile.png
  designation: "Your Designation",
  description: `A short bio about yourself`,
  experience: 5, // Years of experience
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  phone: "+123456789",
  address: "Your Address",
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/yourusername",
  linkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourusername/",
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
  stackOverflow: "https://stackoverflow.com/users/yourid",
  leetcode: "https://leetcode.com/yourusername/",
  devUsername: "yourDev.toUsername",
  resume: "https://your-resume-link",
};
```

3. Update the `metaData` object in the same file to personalize the website's metadata (title, description, and SEO keywords).

### Example of `metaData`:

```typescript
export const metaData = {
  title: "Your Name - Your Designation",
  description: "A brief overview of your skills and expertise",
  keywords: [
    "Your Name",
    "Your Designation",
    "Portfolio Website",
    "JavaScript Developer",
  ],
};
```

4. Save the file and reload your development server. Your custom portfolio is now ready!

5. You have to integrate [Resend](https://resend.com/) to receive contact emails. You can signup and get the api key and add it in `.env` file.
6. To update the icon.ico in src/app, you can generate it from [Fav Icon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
